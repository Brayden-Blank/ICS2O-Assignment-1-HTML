  <h1> Early Life</h1>
  <p1> Larry Page was born March 26, 1973 in Lansing, Michigan, United States. As a child, his older brother taught him to take things apart and soon after he was taking everything in the house apart to find out how they worked. <br> </br>He said that “From a very early age, I also realized I wanted to invent things.” In school, Page went on to earn a Bachelor of Science in computer engineering at the University of Michigan, and a Master of Science in computer science from Stanford University. </p1> 
  <h2> Search Engine Development </h2>
    <p2> During his time in Stanford, Page would start researching which web pages linked to a given page, considering the number and nature of backlinks as valuable information for that page. A fellow Stanford student by the name of Sergey Brin joined Page in this project, which would be nicknamed backrub. <br></br> During this time, Brin and Page realized that the algorithm they were using could be used to create a better search engine than the already existing ones. In August of 1996, the first version of Google was made available on the internet, however it was still on the Stanford University website.</p2> 
    <h3> Google </h3>
    <p3> In 1998, Brin and Page incorporated Google Inc. The initial domain name was “Googol,” derived from the number that consists of one followed by one hundred zeros. Page named himself CEO and Brin served as Google’s president. The mission of the site was to “Organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible.” Today, Google is the most widely used search engine in the world, with over 70% of the search market share. <br></br> In December of 2019, Page announced that he would be stepping down as CEO of Alphabet, Google's parent company. As of March 9th 2022, Page has an estimated Net Worth of 107.9 billion dollars.</p3>
